Both StandardScaler (from sklearn.preprocessing) and minmax_scaling (from mlxtend.preprocessing) do feature scaling — that is, transforming numeric columns to comparable ranges so no single feature dominates due to magnitude differences.

But how they scale and when to use them differ.

⚙️ 2️⃣ What each does
🧩 StandardScaler (z-score normalization)
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)


🔹 Formula:
    (  x - 𝜇 / σ )

where
μ = mean of the feature
σ = standard deviation of the feature

🔹 Effect:

Centers data around 0
Scales it so that variance = 1
Produces values that can be negative

🔹 Use when:

Your features follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution or are roughly bell-shaped.

You’re using algorithms that assume standardized data, like:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
SVM
K-Means
PCA
Neural Networks (sometimes)

🔹 Example:

Before:  [10, 100, 1000]
After:   [-0.7,  0.0,  0.7]

🧩 MinMax Scaling (from mlxtend.preprocessing)
from mlxtend.preprocessing import minmax_scaling
X_scaled = minmax_scaling(X, columns=['feature1', 'feature2'])


🔹 Formula:
    
	(​X - Xmin / Xmax - Xmin)

🔹 Effect:

Rescales values to a fixed range, usually [0, 1]

Preserves the shape of the original distribution

No centering — everything just fits between 0 and 1

🔹 Use when:

You need bounded features (e.g., in neural networks or distance-based algorithms where magnitude matters).

You have non-normal distributions or features with different units/scales.

You want to preserve the original relationships between data points.

Using Neural Networks, KNN, Tree-based models
🔹 Example:

Before:  [10, 100, 1000]
After:   [0.0, 0.09, 1.0]

NB: Using Decision Trees / RandomForest / XGBoost => No scaling needed
